# Image Slider (Carousel)

Simple HTML and CSS image slider with minimum JavaScript.

PageSpeed Insight friendly. Images (after 1st) lazy loaded without significant impact on FCP.

This script is based on 8 images but can be easily extended or trimmed. Add (or remove) `slide-container` part and `dots` in `slider-dots`.
